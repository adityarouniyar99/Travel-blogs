        <h2>Janaki Temple</h2>
        <p>Janaki Temple is a deeply cherished Hindu temple located in Janakpurdham, Nepal, dedicated to Goddess Sita (also known as Janaki), the beloved consort of Lord Rama. It stands as a symbol of devotion, purity, and divine love, making it one of the most culturally and spiritually significant destinations in Nepal. Constructed in exquisite Mughal and Rajput architectural style, the temple gleams in white, almost like a palace carved from moonlight. According to ancient legends, this is the place where Sita was born and raised, and where Lord Rama broke the sacred bow to win her hand in marriage — a love story that echoes across centuries and scriptures.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The first thing you notice is its grandeur — wide courtyards, tall arched windows, delicate hand-painted borders, and its soft pastel color palette that looks even more magical in the early morning light.It feels less like a building and more like a living heritage.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is the place where it is believed that Sita was born and raised Which means, when you step here, you’re not just visiting a temple —you’re stepping into the Ramayana itself.</p>

        <h2>Ganga sagar</h2>
        <p>Ganga Sagar is one of the most sacred and serene ponds located in Janakpurdham, Nepal, holding deep religious significance for devotees and locals alike. It sits near the Janaki Temple and is closely tied to the legends of King Janak, the father of Goddess Sita. According to tradition, this holy pond was filled with the blessed waters brought from the sacred Ganges River of India. Because of this, Ganga Sagar is believed to carry the spiritual purity, divine energy, and blessings of the Ganga itself. People come here to cleanse their minds, offer prayers, and take part in age-old rituals that connect them to centuries of devotion.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The pond is surrounded by the colorful life of Janakpur — temples echoing chants, pilgrims walking softly with offerings, and small shops breathing out the smell of incense and flowers. During festivals like Chhath, the area around Ganga Sagar lights up with thousands of lamps, songs of devotion, and the gentle reflection of faith on water. Devotees stand in stillness as the sun rises or sets, offering their prayers directly to the light — it’s a moment that feels like the entire world pauses to breathe.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Visitors are encouraged to maintain the sanctity of the area, to keep the surroundings clean, and to observe the calm reverence the place holds. You’ll often see people sitting quietly near the water, just watching the ripples — it’s the kind of place that doesn’t need words to be meaningful.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the quiet hours of early morning or just before dusk, Ganga Sagar feels almost otherworldly. The reflections of temples, trees, and sky shimmer across the water like a painting in motion. People come here not just to worship, but to think, to breathe, to let their hearts settle. Elders tell stories of Sita and King Janak, children feed the fish with giggles, and travelers sit with notebooks trying to capture a feeling that can’t quite fit into words. The pond isn’t just water — it’s memory, heritage, and a gentle reminder that faith doesn’t always shout; sometimes, it whispers.</p>
