        <h2>Pashupatinath Temple</h2>
        <p>Pashupatinath is a sacred Hindu temple in Kathmandu, Nepal, dedicated to Lord Shiva and considered a significant national deity and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is one of the oldest and most visited Hindu temples, located on the banks of the Bagmati River and notable for its large complex and religious ceremonies. According to mythology, Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati once took the form of deer and stayed in the area, and the temple has become a major pilgrimage site, especially during the festival of Mahashivratri.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This temple situated on the banks of the holy River Bagmati is the most revered Hindu temple in Nepal. The main temple complex is open only to the Hindus; non-Hindus must satisfy themselves by observing from the terraces just across the Bagmati River to the east. As a mark of reverence and tradition, leather items that include shoes, belts and cameras are forbidden within the temple complex and must be left outside. Photography is strictly prohibited. </p>
        <br>
        <p>They arrive here to find shelter for the last several weeks of their lives, to meet death, be cremated on the banks of the river and travel their last journey with the waters of the sacred river Bagmati, which later meets the holy river Ganges. Hinduists from every corner of Nepal and India are arriving here to die.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It is believed that those who die in Pashupatinath Temple are reborn as a human, regardless of any misconduct that could worsen their karma. The exact day of their death is predicted by astrologers of the temple. If you are attracted to the places where the spirit of death can be felt, then consider Pashupatinath as your first destination. It is a temple with special atmosphere of death; death is present in almost every ritual and every corner of it.</p>

        <h2>Swayambhunath Temple</h2>
        <p>Swayambhu is often referred to as the oldest known stupa of Nepal, with evidence pointing up to 2000 years back. Even though the exact date of its construction is unknown, it is truly a marvel built and rebuilt several times throughout history. The stories, cherished by the locals, have been passed down through generations and hold a special place in their hearts.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Kathmandu Valley was once a large lake, known as Nagdaha, considered a holy site by sages and religious figures. Once on a visit, Vipasvi Buddha (the first incarnation of Shakyamuni Buddha) cast a lotus seed into the lake, which later transformed into a celestial light known as the Aadi Buddha. The self-illuminating light elevated the overall popularity of the Nagdaha. The light was also named Swayambhu i.e. self-existent.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Swayambhunath, also called the monkey temple, is home to hundreds of playful and mischievous monkeys that roam stupa grounds, delighting visitors and locals alike. They are often seen climbing on the temple walls, swinging from trees, and playing with each other. The monkeys are an integral part of Swayambhu’s history with several myths revering them as the protectors of Swayambhu.</p>

        <h2>Godawari Botanical Garden</h2>
        <p>Godawari Botanical Garden (officially known as the National Botanical Garden) is Kathmandu’s only botanical garden, and it was established by King Mahendra in 1962 AD. It was designed by two famous British botanists G.A.C Herklots and Tony Schilling. Tony Schillings has also worked with the Royal Botanical Gardens in the United Kingdom. He’s brought plants back from all over the Himalayas to be planted and studied in the gardens there.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The gardens take up just over 200 acres of land. The garden is not only a beautiful place to visit, it also has educational centers which are frequented by local students as well as research centers to study the indigenous plants of Nepal. The garden got its nickname from the Godawari River which runs through it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>While you can visit Godawari Botanical Garden year round, it’s best to go in the spring because, well, it’s a botanical garden! In spring, the majority of the garden will be in full bloom which will make it much more exciting to visit. You’ll also have wonderful weather as it won’t be too cold like the winter or raining like the summer. In Nepal, spring falls during the months of late February, March, and April.</p>
